    - Get Member Promotions
    - Member Benefits
    - Member Profile
    - Member Vouchers
    - Transaction History
    - Opt Out from a Promotion

### Usage

1. Create an instance of `LoyaltyAPIManager` with the necessary parameters:

```
val loyaltyAPIManager = LoyaltyAPIManager(
            auth = forceAuthManager,
            instanceUrl = mInstanceUrl,
            loyaltyClient = LoyaltyClient(forceAuthManager, mInstanceUrl)
        )```

2. Call the appropriate methods to interact with the Loyalty Management API:

```Kotlin
import LoyaltyMobileSDK

val forceAuthManager = ForceAuthManager(applicationContext)
val mInstanceUrl =
            forceAuthManager.getInstanceUrl() ?: AppSettings.DEFAULT_FORCE_CONNECTED_APP.instanceUrl
val loyaltyAPIManager = LoyaltyAPIManager(
            auth = forceAuthManager,
            instanceUrl = mInstanceUrl,
            loyaltyClient = LoyaltyClient(forceAuthManager, mInstanceUrl)
        )         
        
// Enroll Members
let membershipNumber = "1234567890"
let firstName = "John"
let lastName = "Doe"
let email = "john.doe@example.com"
let phone = "4157891234"
let emailNotification = true

loyaltyAPIManager.postEnrollment(
                    firstName = firstName,
                    lastName = lastName,
                    email = email,
                    additionalContactAttributes = mapof("phone" to phone),
                    emailNotification = emailNotification,
                    memberStatus = MemberStatus.ACTIVE,
                    createTransactionJournals = true,
                    transactionJournalStatementFrequency = TransactionalJournalStatementFrequency.MONTHLY,
                    transcationJournalStatementMethod = TransactionalJournalStatementMethod.EMAIL,
                    enrollmentChannel = EnrollmentChannel.EMAIL,
                    canReceivePromotions = true,
                    canReceivePartnerPromotions = true
                )

// Retrieve the member benefits
loyaltyAPIManager.getMemberBenefits(memberId = null, membershipKey = "1234567890")

// Retrieve the member profile
loyaltyAPIManager.getMemberProfile(memberId = null, membershipKey = "1234567890", programCurrencyName = null)

// Opt in a promotion for member
loyaltyAPIManager.enrollInPromotions(membershipNumber = "1234567890", promotionName = "PromotionName")

// Opt out a member from a promotion using promotion ID or promotion name
loyaltyAPIManager.unEnrollPromotion(membershipNumber = "1234567890", promotionName = "PromotionName")

// Retrieve loyalty member transactions
loyaltyAPIManager.getTransactions(membershipNumber = "1234567890", pageNumber = null, 
            journalTypeName = null, journalSubTypeName = null, periodStartDate = null, periodEndDate = null)

// Retrieve promotions for a loyalty member
loyaltyAPIManager.getEligiblePromotions(membershipKey = "1234567890", memberId = null)

// Retrieve vouchers for a loyalty member
loyaltyAPIManager.getVouchers(
                membershipKey = "1234567890", vouchreStatus = null, pageNumber = 1, productId = null,
                productCategoryId = null, productName = null, productCategoryName = null
