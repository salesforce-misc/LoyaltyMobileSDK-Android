## ForceSwift

ForceSwift is a library that uses SwiftUI to build user interfaces in iOS apps while interacting with Salesforce. ForceSwift provides tools, structures, classes, and utilities that make it easier to perform common operations, such as authentication and network requests. Key components of ForceSwift include:

- `ForceAPI` - A struct that generates the path for API endpoints, based on the API name and version.
- `ForceAuthenticator` - A  protocol that defines the required methods for handling access tokens in Salesforce API.
- `ForceClient` - A class that handles network requests with authentication by using `ForceAuthenticator`. This class provides methods to fetch data from Salesforce API or a local JSON file.
- `ForceRequest` - A struct to help create and configure URLRequest instances. It provides utility functions to create requests with a URL, add query parameters, and set authorization.
- `NetworkManagerProtocol` - A protocol that defines the requirements for a network manager.
- `NetworkManager` - A class that handles network requests and data processing. This class conforms to the NetworkManagerProtocol and provides a method to fetch and decode the data into the specified type.

## LoyaltyAPIManager

The `LoyaltyAPIManager` class manages requests related to loyalty programs using the Force API. Interact with the Salesforce Loyalty Management API and retrieve member benefits, transactions, profile, and more, in development and production environments. With LoyaltyAPIManager, you can:
- Manage authentication by creating an instance of ForceAuthenticator.
- Interact with the Loyalty Management APIs, including:
    - Individual Member Enrollments
    - Enroll for Promotions
    - Get Member Promotions
    - Member Benefits
    - Member Profile
    - Member Vouchers
    - Transaction History
    - Opt Out from a Promotion
- Support both live API calls and local JSON file fetch for development mode.
- Manage asynchronous requests by using Swift Aync/Await syntax.

### Usage

1. Create an instance of `LoyaltyAPIManager` with the necessary parameters:

```swift
let loyaltyAPIManager = LoyaltyAPIManager(auth: forceAuthenticator, loyaltyProgramName: "YourLoyaltyProgramName", instanceURL: "YourInstanceURL", forceClient: forceClient)
```

2. Call the appropriate methods to interact with the Loyalty Management API:

```swift
import LoyaltyMobileSDK

let instanceURL = URL(string: "https://your_salesforce_instance_url")!
let loyaltyProgramName = "YourLoyaltyProgramName"
let forceClient = ForceClient(clientId: "your_client_id", clientSecret: "your_client_secret", redirectURI: "your_redirect_uri")

let loyaltyAPIManager = LoyaltyAPIManager(instanceURL: instanceURL, loyaltyProgramName: loyaltyProgramName, forceClient: forceClient)

// Enroll Members
let membershipNumber = "1234567890"
let firstName = "John"
let lastName = "Doe"
let email = "john.doe@example.com"
let phone = "4157891234"
let emailNotification = true

let enrollmentOutput = try await loyaltyAPIManager.postEnrollment(
    membershipNumber: membershipNumber,
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    email: email,
    phone: phone,
    emailNotification: emailNotification
)

// Retrieve the member benefits
let benefits = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getMemberBenefits(for: "memberId")

// Retrieve the member profile
let profile = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getMemberProfile(for: "memberId")

// Retrive the community member profile
let communityProfile = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getCommunityMemberProfile()

// Opt in a promotion for member
try await loyaltyAPIManager.enrollIn(promotion: "PromotionName", for: "1234567890")

// Opt out a member from a promotion using promotion ID or promotion name
try await loyaltyAPIManager.unenroll(promotionId: "promotionId", for: "1234567890")
try await loyaltyAPIManager.unenroll(promotionName: "PromotionName", for: "1234567890")

// Retrieve loyalty member transactions
let transactions = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getTransactions(for: "1234567890")

// Retrieve promotions for a loyalty member
let promotions = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getPromotions(membershipNumber: "1234567890")

// Retrieve vouchers for a loyalty member
let vouchers = try await loyaltyAPIManager.getVouchers(membershipNumber: "1234567890")

```

## Test the Loyalty Management Mobile SDK for iOS and Sample App

Run the `run_tests.sh` script from the command line to test the LoyaltyMobileSDK-iOS and the sample app. To ensure that the script is executable, run the `chmod +x run_tests.sh` script. The script provides these capabilities.
- Verifies if `xcpretty` is installed, which is a formatter for xcodebuild and makes the output more readable. If not installed, install `xcpretty` by using the code `gem install xcpretty`.
- Determines the tests to run and whether the tests save the logs and reports.
  Runs tests for the specified schemes and test targets. Also provides options to customize the test run. To customize the `run_tests.sh` script, choose from these options:
    - `-full`: Run all tests for the SDK and the sample app.
    - `-sdkOnly`: Run only the SDK tests.
    - `-appOnly`: Run only the sample app tests.
    - `-log`: Save the test output to a log file in the `build/TestRun_TIMESTAMP` directory.
    - `-report`: Save test reports as HTML files in the `build/TestRun_TIMESTAMP` directory.

### Examples

- Run SDK tests only:

  ```bash
  ./run_tests.sh
  ```

- Run all tests and save logs and reports:

  ```bash
  ./run_tests.sh -full -log -report
  ```

- Run sample app tests and save logs:

  ```bash
  ./run_tests.sh -appOnly -log
  ```
